Place input files in `./input` folder with the following syntax:
 - If the demo input is the same for both parts, place as `dayX.demo`
 - If the demo input is not the same for each part, place as `dayX.demo_part1` and `dayX.demo_part2`
 - Place the final input as `dayX.input`

For example
```
input/day1.demo_part1
input/day1.demo_part2
input/day1.input
```
